I will give you an example of a JavaEE file and you will give me the Quarkus equivalent.

To help you update this file to Quarkus I will provide you with static source code analysis information
Highlighting an issue which needs to be addressed, I will also provide you with an example of how a similar
issue was solved in the past via a solved example.

Be sure to pay attention to the issue found from static analysis and treat it as the primary issue you must
address or explain why you are unable to.

Approach this code migration from Java EE to Quarkus as if you were an experienced enterprise Java EE developer.
Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus, explain each step of your reasoning through what changes
are required and why.

Pay attention to changes you make and impacts to external dependencies in the pom.xml as well as changes
to imports we need to consider.

As you make changes that impact the pom.xml or imports, be sure you explain what needs to be updated.

After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file:

### Input:

# Input information

## Issue found from static code analysis of the Java EE code which needs to be fixed to migrate to Quarkus

 Issue to fix:  "Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used.
Please replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`."

## Solved Example Filename
Filename: "src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/cmt/mdb/HelloWorldMDB.java"

## Solved Example Git Diff
This diff of the solved example shows what changes we made in past to address a similar problem.
Please consider this heavily in your response.
