  ## Reasoning
  The first step is to identify the issue that needs to be addressed. In this case, the issue is that the `@MessageDriven` annotation is not supported in Quarkus and needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.

  The next step is to identify the changes that need to be made to the code. In this case, the `@MessageDriven` annotation needs to be replaced with the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation. Additionally, the `implements MessageListener` interface needs to be removed, as it is not needed in Quarkus.

  The next step is to identify the changes that need to be made to the imports. In this case, the `import javax.ejb.MessageDriven` and `import javax.jms.MessageListener` imports need to be removed, as they are not needed in Quarkus. Additionally, the `import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` and `import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` imports need to be added, as they are needed in Quarkus.

  The next step is to identify the changes that need to be made to the pom.xml file. In this case, the `quarkus-resteasy-reactive-jackson` dependency needs to be added, as it is needed in Quarkus. Additionally, the `quarkus-resteasy-reactive-jsonb` dependency needs to be added, as it is needed in Quarkus.

  The next step is to identify the changes that need to be made to the code. In this case, the `onMessage` method needs to be replaced with the `@Incoming` annotation. Additionally, the `implements MessageListener` interface needs to be removed, as it is not needed in Quarkus.

  The next step is to identify the changes that need to be made to the imports. In this case, the `import javax.ejb.MessageDriven` and `import javax.jms.MessageListener` imports need to be removed, as they are not needed in Quarkus.
