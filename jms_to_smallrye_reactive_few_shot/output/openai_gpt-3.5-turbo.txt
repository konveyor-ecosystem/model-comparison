## Reasoning
1. The issue found from static code analysis is that Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus and CDI must be used instead. Therefore, the `@MessageDriven` annotation needs to be replaced with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
2. The solved example provided a clear pattern of how to update the Java EE code to Quarkus by replacing the `@MessageDriven` annotation with `@ApplicationScoped` and updating the method signature to use `@Incoming` annotation from MicroProfile Reactive Messaging.
3. The `Logger` import needs to be replaced with `Log` from Quarkus logging.
4. The `jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped` import needs to be added for the CDI scope annotation.
