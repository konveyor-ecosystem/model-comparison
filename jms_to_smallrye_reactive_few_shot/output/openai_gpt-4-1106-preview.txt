## Reasoning

To migrate the given Java EE Message Driven Bean (MDB) to Quarkus, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Replace `@MessageDriven` with `@ApplicationScoped`:** Quarkus does not support EJBs, including MDBs. Instead, we use CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans. The `@ApplicationScoped` annotation indicates that the bean is created once for the application's lifecycle, which is a suitable replacement for the singleton nature of MDBs.

2. **Remove `MessageListener` Interface and `onMessage` Method Signature:** In Quarkus, we don't implement the `MessageListener` interface for reactive messaging. Instead, we use methods annotated with `@Incoming` to denote the channel from which the messages will be consumed.

3. **Replace Logging:** The standard `java.util.logging.Logger` is replaced with `io.quarkus.logging.Log` which is a simplified logging API provided by Quarkus.

4. **Use `@Incoming` Annotation:** The `@Incoming` annotation is used to define the channel that the method will be listening to. The channel name should match the configuration in the `application.properties` file for the message queue.

5. **Update `pom.xml`:** Ensure that the Quarkus dependencies for reactive messaging are included in the `pom.xml` file. This typically includes `quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-jms`.

6. **Configuration Changes:** The `application.properties` file should be updated to include the configuration for the JMS connector, replacing the MDB activation configuration properties.

7. **Handle Exceptions:** Exception handling should be adapted to the Quarkus way, ensuring that any JMSExceptions are handled appropriately.

8. **Remove Unused Imports:** Since we are changing the implementation, some imports will no longer be necessary and should be removed.

Now, let's apply these changes to the provided input file.

## Updated File

```java
package org.jboss.as.quickstarts.mdb;

import io.quarkus.logging.Log;
import jakarta.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
import org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming;

/**
 * <p>
 * A simple bean that asynchronously receives and processes the messages that are sent to the queue.
 * </p>
 *
 * @author Serge Pagop (spagop@redhat.com)
 */
@ApplicationScoped
public class HelloWorldQueueMDB {

    @Incoming("HELLOWORLDMDBQueue")
    public void onMessage(String msg) {
        Log.info("Received Message from queue: " + msg);
    }
}
```

### Additional Notes:

- The `@Incoming` annotation's value `"HELLOWORLDMDBQueue"` should match the configured channel name in `application.properties`. You will need to configure the channel to connect to the JMS queue.
- The `application.properties` file should include the necessary configuration for the JMS connector, which might look something like this:

```properties
mp.messaging.incoming.HELLOWORLDMDBQueue.connector=smallrye-jms
mp.messaging.incoming.HELLOWORLDMDBQueue.destination=queue/HELLOWORLDMDBQueue
```

- Ensure that the Quarkus extension for SmallRye Reactive Messaging JMS is added to your `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-smallrye-reactive-messaging-jms</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

- The `Logger` import and any other unused imports should be removed from the file.
- Exception handling should be reviewed and adapted to the Quarkus reactive messaging paradigm. The example does not include exception handling, but in a real-world scenario, you would need to consider how to handle exceptions that occur during message processing.
